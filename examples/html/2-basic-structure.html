	<h1> Basic HTML Structure </h1>

	<p>If you open previous 1-tag.html file in your browser, and inspect it (using developer tool, Press F12) you will see that some codes are automatically generated. That is the standard HTML structure. </p>

	<p>Output of the HTML structure does not affected by the number of tabs, spaces or line-breaks (Enter). </p>

	<p>Usually inner elements are tabbed to increase readability.</p>

	<p>As like animals, html has two parts - Head and body.</p>

	<p>In this document we used only tilte tag inside head. Check the difference in title (browser tab) with 1-tag.html.</p>
